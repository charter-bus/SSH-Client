# SSH-Client
A simple SSH client in Python.

Run <code>ssh_rcmd.py</code>. <br>
<br>
The SSH client Python script will prompt you for the following variables, as a normal SSH client would.
<br>
1. host IP
2. Host port
3. Username
4. Password
<br>
This program is intended for use on systems that do not already have an SSH client installed, such as most Windows machines.
<br>
<br>
The <code>ssh_cmd.py</code> script is a more basic ssh client, with less features, only allowing for a single command to be executed.
<br>
<br>
The <code>ssh_rcmd.py</code> script is an adaptation, allowing for multiple commands through a loop, until the session is closed.
